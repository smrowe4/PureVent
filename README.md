## PureVent
### Goal:  
Design an open source ventilator that can qualify for FDA EAU (Emergency Authorization Use).
### Project Status:
(Note: This project is partially complete.  Files posted reflect the current state of the project.)

- The Ambu Bag does not easily deliver 800 ml of air.  In our testing, we could only achieve 600 ml pushing on the bag by hand.  Current design of PureVent only achieves 300 ml of air.  Will probably change the design or use some other open source design.
- Stepper motors are not powerful enough.  At times the motors will skip steps when pushing on the bag valve mask.
- Software exists in 3 pieces.  Need to combine them into one master file.
